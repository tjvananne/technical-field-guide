# technical-field-guide
All things related to IT, data, and programming that I come across and don't want to forget 


The first way to divide up this information is between the tactical and the strategic

## Tactical:
This is where we'll put the how-to's for specific programming languages and capture those languages' specific idioms. 
An example would be how all of the apply family functions work in R (lapply, sapply, tapply, mapply) or how list comprehension works in Python.

## Strategic:
This is where we'll put generic concepts such as what is happening under the hood of a random forest algorithm. The focus 
is on the generic concept and not so much on the specific language being used (these will more than likely default to R 
until I have a new favorite language).
