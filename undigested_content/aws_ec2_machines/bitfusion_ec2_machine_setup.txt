This is me getting a bitfusion AWS machine up and running:

Getting into the machine ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

following these instructions:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

I need these things:
SSH client: putty
Instance ID: i-01d55ccdbae4b889a
public DNS name: ec2-54-166-167-32.compute-1.amazonaws.com
path to .pem: C:\Users\Taylor\Documents\Nerd\learning\aws_vms\bitfusion01\bifuskp.pem


opened git bash
cd'd into the location of the .pem
executed:
	chmod 400 ./<name of pem>.pem

then:
	This is basically ssh -i <password file> ubuntu@<public DNS fully qualified>
	ssh -i ./bifuskp.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-166-167-32.compute-1.amazonaws.com


SCP (Secury Copy) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instance ID: i-01d55ccdbae4b889a
public DNS name: ec2-54-166-167-32.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(SSH on port 22 was enabled by default by bitfusion, so I don't have to do that explicitly myself -- do it when you make the machine)

# scp (this is the command for secure copy) -r (recursive for directories) -i (tells it to use this .pem file cert) mydir (path to directory to 
ship off) ubuntu@publicdnsfullyqualified.com:~ (fully qualified user@domain with the ":~" on the end as the file path from home)
 scp -r -i ./bifuskp.pem mydir ubuntu@ec2-54-166-167-32.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~


same thing without the "-r" for just single files (then of course point the path to the single file

Tips for using aws for data analysis:
- package everything into a single directory when you transfer it in
- everything should have relative referencing for file paths
- make sure to test it locally of course before spinning up the VM
- (haven't tested this yet) get youself set up on a small instance then increase it later
- my only concern here is that you might lose your storage based on how drastic the switch is?
- utilize the AWS mobile app for monitoring spending and spinning up / shutting down instances



Things I want to try later on:
- if rJava is working, then try setting up email alerts for when things fail using mailR


Things I'm not sure about yet (.pem is only for SSH, I can still RSTUDIO / JUPYTER):
- do I need to have this .pem key on all computers that I want connecting to the remote machine? Is it safe to email this .pem key 


# ok so the proper way to do this is here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3260739/add-keypair-to-existing-ec2-instance
to create an additional key pair you should:
1) get to root and create a new user
2) add that user to sudoers list
3) go back to "ubuntu" user
4) su taylor  # "taylor" is name of second user
5) generate the key and chmod it
6) on local machine, scp it down using original .pem
7) now you have another .pem for an aditional user to log in
# but if I'm a single human... why not just email a copy of the existing original .pem?
...I'm confused.. I think this above is just for additional users
