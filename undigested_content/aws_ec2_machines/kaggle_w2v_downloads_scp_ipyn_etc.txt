Linux terminal (Ubuntu) download a file:

wget to download -------------------------------------------------------------------------

downloads file to current directory:
wget "http://domain.com/directory/4?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=file.tgz" 


downloads file to the directory specified:
wget  -O /home/omio/Desktop/ "http://thecanadiantestbox.x10.mx/CC.zip"


wget with credentials --------------------------------------------------------------------

https://askubuntu.com/questions/29079/how-do-i-provide-a-username-and-password-to-wget
using wget with a password:
wget --user user --password pass http://example.com/


a mildly safer way (note the leading white space, this prevents command from being saved in history):
wget --user=remote_user --password=SECRET ftp://ftp.example.com/file.ext
This still enables people to view password in ps, top, htop, and similar


safest way to do this where password isn't even visible to you:
wget --user=remote_user --ask-password ftp://ftp.example.com/file.ext
Password for user `remote_user': [SECRET (not visible)]


perfect!
wget --user=tjvananne --ask-password <url path to the zip file>


unzipping the downloaded content ---------------------------------------------------------

if `unzip` command isn't available then get it (this is ubuntu)
apt-get install unzip

then use it:
unzip file.zip

ran into this issue:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/54904/unzip-error-end-of-central-directory-signature-not-found


they say to try using this:
jar xvf file.zip

do a `man jar` command to read the docs on this one and test whether its installed
sudo apt-get install fastjar 
this will install it if you don't have it already



this didn't work for a kaggle train file... going to try 7z?
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-and-use-7zip-file-archiver-on-ubuntu-linux/

# going to just install this top first one to see if that is all I need, will circle back if needed
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
sudo apt-get install p7zip-rar

https://askubuntu.com/questions/910349/wget-downloads-an-html-instead-of-my-file/910355 # follow up on this one to see if it ever gets answered


this is a dead end right now... going to try kaggle-cli command line interface
https://github.com/floydwch/kaggle-cli
sudo pip install kaggle-cli


SUCCESS:
https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/554
kg download -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -c COMPETITION
where COMPETITION is the url string of the competition when you visit it in browser

this will likely fail based on the version of html5lib in python
python
import html5lib
html5lib.__version__  # this will likely be something like 0.999999
ctrl Z # exit python


sudo pip install --upgrade html5lib==1.0b8
# Nooow try it, and it should work much better
kg download -u tjvananne -p PASSWORD -c quora-question-pairs

now we can unzip:
unzip train.csv.zip
unzip test.csv.zip
dir  # we can see that we have the files unzipped!



# now for downloading w2v from google
https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/


that leads to here
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM&export=download

its one of these two links
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=Yc2J&id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM

Ok so it was neither of those links...

It is THIS one!
https://doc-0g-8s-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/2p5r2coch6ela8k9dl7gi20290p65a0t/1494424800000/06848720943842814915/*/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM?e=download


so:
wget https://doc-0g-8s-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/2p5r2coch6ela8k9dl7gi20290p65a0t/1494424800000/06848720943842814915/*/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM?e=download


well actually do this to rename the output file:
wget -O w2v_gnews300.bin https://doc-0g-8s-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/2p5r2coch6ela8k9dl7gi20290p65a0t/1494424800000/06848720943842814915/*/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM?e=download


Here's how I found it... in chrome I opened up developer console (F12) then navigated to the "network" tab and clicked the "download" button in the browser. This gave me the actual URL I was being redirected to that housed the physical file.. this downloaded super quickly. Note this will be a binary file.


# transferring the file to remote AWS -----------------------------------------------------

I copied my little .pem key thing into the directory that has my ipython notebook that I want to send to the remote server (also check your notebook to make sure it is ready to be run on AWS -- filepaths and whatnot might be a bit different).

# this is the command, this is all it takes to get it where I want it
$ scp -i ./bitfus_tensor.pem LSTM_word2vec_exp_AWS_remote.ipynb ubuntu@ec2-107-
23-134-148.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/quora_dupes/py_scripts


note: I had to create that "/quora_dupes/py_scripts" file structure in the remote box before running the above command obviously...


# ok so lesson learned here... I need to build my tree directory under the "pynb" directory at the root of my ubuntu login on the remote box... this appears to be the entry point for jupyter notebook.

this was an easy fix, cd to the root where `dir` shows "pynb" and "quora_dupes"
sudo mv quora_dupes pynb/quora_dupes

now I have moved all of the quora_dupes directory and its contents underneath pynb
(I didn't even have to restart jupyter, this updated automatically to show me the new content. Cool!)


Ok.... my issue was that I didn't have the correct kernel going.. I had "no kernel"... it was hard to tell on mobile

so now I'm running into an issue where I think my googlenews w2v isn't correct or is corrupt on the remote box (it took a suspiciously small amount of time to download, so I thought something was wrong.)


When I pick this back up... do these steps:
locally cd into LARGE_FILES_word_vectors in the quora dupes repo:
$ scp -i ../py_scripts/bitfus_tensor.pem GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin ubuntu@ec2-34-204-37-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~
