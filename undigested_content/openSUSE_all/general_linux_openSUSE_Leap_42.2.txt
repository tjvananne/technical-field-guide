# General Linux commands in openSUSE Leap 42.2

# 0) create a group

    groupadd <groupname>
    
    sudo groupadd rstudio_users
    

# 1) add existing user to a group

    "-a" is append the user to the groups in "-G"
    
    "-G" which group to add the user to

    sudo usermod -aG rstudio_users taylor
    
    # to check what groups a user is in:
    
    groups <username>
    
    groups taylor
    
    # to grep who all is in a group
    
    grep 'rstudio_users' /etc/group
    

# 2) adding a user with a specific group

    # template:
    useradd -g <group> -p <password> -d /home/<homefolder name> -m <username>
    
    # added a test user.. but they can't log in    


# 3) it is very helpful to be able to see running processes and kill them if needed

	# this will be a good way to see all running processes
	ps aufx 

	# grep for specific processes
	ps aufx | grep 'shiny-server'

	# find process by PID (should be second column)
	sudo kill -9 <pid>

	# I don't know what the "-9" flag does, but it works if you don't include it as well
