# 1) Install R base

    sudo zypper install R-base

status: successful
    
# 2) download necessary files

    cd ~/Downloads
    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-suse-1.0.143-x86_64.rpm
    
# 3) move the files to where I want them

    cd ..
    mv ~/Downloads/rstudio-server-suse-1.0.143-x86_64.rpm rstudio-server-suse-1.0.143-x86_64.rpm
    
# 4) install

    sudo zypper install rstudio-server-suse-1.0.143-x86_64.rpm
    
# 5) testing to make sure it worked

    # this checks /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf and
    # /etc/rstudio/rsession.conf to make sure they're valid
    sudo rstudio-server verify-installation
    
Now you should be able to open your browser on this box and go to the local ip address and port 8787 to view the rstudio login screen

http://127.0.0.1:8787

# NOTE: In order to have multiple versions of R accessible from RStudio / Rstudio Server, you have to build each R instance from source

# 6) log in to rstudio server (open source)

you can use your main system-login credentials in rstudio server to log in. One of the next steps is going to be setting up new users and limiting their resource usage.

# 7) Install gcc so we can compile and install new R packages

    # many tidyverse packages rely on these
    sudo zypper install gcc
    # -n is for "non-interactive" mode which doesn't confirm install
    sudo zypper -n install gcc-c++

Now we'll be able to install R packages in R studio server

# 8) Configuring RStudio server

    # this is how to change the default port for rstudio server to listen on
    # /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
    www-port=80
    
    # rstudio binds to address 0.0.0.0 (accepting connections from any remote ip)
    # change this by using www-address entry
    www-address=127.0.0.1
    # now only local host can access this
    
    # always restart server after making changes:
    sudo rstudio-server restart
    
    # selecting which version of R to use
    rsession-which-r=/usr/local/bin/R
    
    # limit rstudio access to only members of specific group
    auth-required-user-group=rstudio_users
