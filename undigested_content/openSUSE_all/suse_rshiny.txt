# Installing R Shiny

So first thing, you should already have R base installed (make sure it is at least 3.2.2, as that is what these directions specify

# 1) install shiny

go into R, or Rstudio server, or wherever R is.
	
	install.packages("shiny")



# 2) download the necessary files:

	wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.3.838-rh5-x86_64.rpm

	# run install

	sudo zypper install shiny-server-1.5.3.838-rh5-x86_64.rpm

	# you'll get a dependency warning here, just select the second (2) option
	# which threatens you that stuff will break, its fine. this is fine.


# 3) make some changes to config files

	vim ~/.Rprofile

	# add this stuff:
	options(download.file.method = "libcurl")
	local({
		r <- getOption("repos")
		r["CRAN"] <- "https://cran.rstudio.com/"
		options(repos=r)
	})


# 4) install the shiny package

	sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('shiny')\""
	# this didn't really work, something about a mirror isn't set...
	# lets just go into R and do the shiny install from there and see if that works





# 3) stopping and starting

	sudo systemctl start shiny-server
	# this doesn't work...

	# I think this'll be better:
	sudo systemctl enable shiny-server

	# this gives the message:
	# shiny-server.service is not a native service, redirecting to systemd-sysv-install
	# Executing /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable shiny-server

	# someone here mentions the need for a symlink between shiny-server.service and
	# some other file... now at least I know where some of this stuff is located.

# 4) ok so critical user information...

	# check whats in the config file
	sudo vim /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf

	# there is a "run_as" flag... it should say "shiny"
	# I think we need to create this user and give it some good access
