several issues with R in ubuntu:

4/27/2017 - I didn't realize until completing all of these steps that, the way I built my version of R on Ubuntu (so that it could use the tm package) also disabled any form of plotting to the graphics device... Not sure how to resolve that.

0) not sure how to upgrade R version in ubuntu ------------------

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-16-04-2

add external repository maintained by CRAN
this will request keys?
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9

(above did not work, the request timed out - article is from Sept 2016)


0.5) another attempt

https://askubuntu.com/questions/824397/upgrade-r-3-2-to-3-3-using-tar-gz-file-on-ubuntu-16-04


https://cran.rstudio.com
for Linux -> Ubuntu -> Xenial -> r-base_3.3.2.orig.tar.gz



download from cran -> ubuntu -> 3.3.2

cd into downloads folder and execute:
tar xf r-base_3.3.2.orig.tar.gz
cd R-3.3.2
apt-get install gfortran libreadline-dev bzip2-dev liblzma-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
./configure --enable-R-shlib=yes --with-readline=no --with-x=no
sudo make
sudo make install

# ok, so that process appears to have installed this version of R and overwrote the
# previously installed version which was 3.2.x...

# but! if we see that both versions still exist, do the following "path" manipulation
# for RStudio to know which version of R to use

# add this line to the bottom of ".profile" in my "home" dir
# need to open file explorer, go to view, and "show hidden files"
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R="/home/taylor/Downloads/R-3.3.2/bin/R"


# add this to /etc/environment
RSTUDIO_WHICH_R="/home/taylor/Downloads/R-3.3.2/bin/R"


ERROR LOG for 0.5) *******************
./configure


output:
configure: error: --with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available

Going to try the provided tips for libreadline-dev install

same error:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17473547/error-with-readline-yes-default-and-headers-libs-are-not-available

trying this advice from this link above
so now run this one:

./configure --with-readline=no --with-x=no

got the "R is now configured" message so it was successful

now execute the "make" command to build it out:
make

this is taking a good long while

so I think I just installed this all into "downloads" directory.. maybe that is ok?

this worked fine, but then when adding this bin/R directory to the
path for RStudio, it crashed

cd back into that R-3.3.2 directory and back out of this

execute:
make uninstall

(no never mind, go back to download and unzip the tar.gz again)

then try this one:
cd R-3.3.2
./configure --enable-R-shlib=yes --with-readline=no --with-x=no
sudo make
sudo make install





1) can't install devtools ----------------------

devtools requires these system packages:

sudo apt-get -y install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev

sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('devtools', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')\""

I can now "library(devtools)" - NICE!




2) installing with devtools ---------------------

# install.packages("devtools")
    # library(devtools)
    # 
    # slam_url <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/slam/slam_01.1-37.tar.gz"
    # slam_url <- "https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/slam_0.1-40.tar.gz"
    # install_url(slam_url)
