recently added a ".gitignore" file to make sure that large files are not added to this repo unnecessarily (keep the code and references to the data we need, but not the data itself).

Will need to redo some of the IO to match this format to keep the repo clean

ignoring directories with this string in it:
*LARGE_FILES*
