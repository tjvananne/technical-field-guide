# Dailies

## JavaScript Dailies:

### Must know before moving on to node or jquery:

I must be able to implement and explain each of these without reference:

* ~~object prototypal inheritance~~
* function methods (apply vs call) - use them within object properties too
* closures (and all scoping rules)
* callbacks
* iife's, when to use, how to use, etc
* ES16 changes (arrow functions and class-like object constructors)
