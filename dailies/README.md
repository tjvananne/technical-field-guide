# Dailies

Dailies are a way to keep revisiting new things I am learning. When I spend a month learning Javascript, I want to constantly revisit how property inheritance works, how prototyping works, what all changed with ES6 and how things can be done the ES5 way, etc. 


Eventually, content in the dailies section will be moved into its rightful place in either the strategic or tactical directories (most likely for a specific language's programming idiom section).
